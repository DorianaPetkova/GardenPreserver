tulip
overall: Tulips come in a wide variety of colors including red, yellow, pink, purple, orange, and white. Some tulips are even multicolored, featuring streaks, stripes, or edges in contrasting colors. Popular varieties include the Darwin Hybrid, which is known for its large, bright flowers, and the Triumph tulip, prized for its sturdy stems and vibrant hues.
water: Tulips require regular watering, especially during their growing season. After planting, water the bulbs thoroughly to settle the soil. During the growing period, ensure the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. Reduce watering once the foliage starts to die back.
soil: The soil must be well-drained and loose; heavy or wet soils can cause the bulbs to rot. Ideally, the soil should be slightly acidic to neutral (pH 6.0 to 7.0). To improve drainage, you can mix in some sand or organic matter such as compost.
light: Tulips prefer full or afternoon sun, so choose a location that gets at least six hours of direct sunlight per day.

water: Drought tolerant; water as needed.
soil: Light, well-drained soil.
light: Sun or shade.

edelweiss
overall: To support edelweiss's health and enhance its blooming, use balanced nutrition fertilizers annually in spring. During growth seasons, high-phosphorus fertilizers encourage better flowering.

water: Not specified; generally moderate watering.
soil: Lean, well-draining soil.
light: Not specified; generally full sun to partial shade.

epiphyllum oxypetalum
overall: Give this plant a well-drained average succulent/cactus soil mix in partial shade or bright, indirect light. Soak the soil completely when watering and water frequently, letting the top of the soil dry out between watering.
water: Soak the soil completely when watering and water frequently.
soil: Well-drained average succulent/cactus soil mix.
light: Partial shade or bright, indirect light.

forsythia
overall: Once established, forsythia needs little care apart from pruning once flowering has finished.

water: Little care needed once established.
soil: Well-rotted organic matter for mulch.
light: Not specified; generally full sun to partial shade.

In cooler climates, harvest the corms after the foliage dies back in the summer.
water: Water regularly, keeping the soil moist but not overly saturated.
soil: Not specified; generally well-draining soil.
light: Not specified; generally full sun to partial shade.

frangipani
overall: Growing frangipani requires patience, but you can help your plant achieve its optimal growth rate by ensuring it receives ample sunlight, watering it regularly during the dry months, and letting the soil dry between each watering.

water: Water every two to three days.
soil: Not specified; generally well-draining soil.
light: Not specified; generally full sun to partial shade.

hydrangea
overall: Hydrangeas do best in moist soil and can wilt in hot weather, so keep them well-watered during hot spells in summer. Mulch hydrangeas every year in spring with leaf mould, well-rotted manure, or compost. They don't need feeding, as this encourages leafy growth at the expense of flowers.
water: Keep well-watered during hot spells in summer.
soil: Moist soil.
light: Not specified; generally partial shade to full sun.

water: Reduced watering during rest period.
soil: Not specified; generally well-draining soil.
light: Adequate, indirect light during the day.

lavender
overall: Lavender tends to be trouble-free if grown in the conditions it enjoys. A sun-drenched spot with free-draining soil is ideal.

water: Not specified; generally moderate water needs.
soil: Free-draining soil.
light: Sun-drenched spot.

lobelia
overall: Lobelia cardinalis is best grown in sun or partial shade. It needs very moist, fertile soil that doesn't dry out. Lobelia tupa is best grown in full sun in a sheltered spot and fertile, well-drained soil. It may need protection in hard winters.

water: Not specified; generally moderate water needs.
soil: Slightly acidic to alkaline, well-drained soil.
light: Full sun.

marigold
overall: Marigolds are heat-loving plants that thrive in zones 2 to 11. They are easily grown in full sun (at least 6 hours of sunlight daily) in moderately fertile, dry to moist, well-drained soils. Some light afternoon shade prolongs their blooms in hot summer areas.

soil: Not applicable; typically grown in specialized orchid mix.
light: Bright, indirect light.

poinsettia
overall: Avoid placing poinsettias where the temperature fluctuates or may be drying, such as near cold drafts, heat ducts, fireplaces, fans, space heaters, etc. Keep soil moist. Water plant when the soil surface feels dry to a light touch, or the pot feels lightweight when lifted. Never allow poinsettias to get so dry that they wilt.
water: Keep soil moist.
soil: Not specified; generally well-draining soil.
light: Avoid direct sunlight.

overall: During the first year, they need some extra watering and fertilizing. This helps them to set down a strong root system and get established in their space. Once established, there is very little that needs to be done to maintain these plants.
water: Not specified; generally moderate water needs.
soil: Not specified; generally well-draining soil.
light: Not specified; generally full sun.

soil: Well-drained soils.
light: Not specified; generally full sun to partial shade.

red spider lilies
overall: Spider lilies require regular watering when they are growing and flowering to ensure the soil stays moist.

water: Regular watering when growing and flowering.
soil: Not specified; generally moist soil.
light: Not specified; generally full sun to partial shade.

soil: Not specified; generally well-draining soil.
light: Not specified; generally partial shade to full sun.

snapdragon
overall: Snapdragons do best in rich, well-draining soil in a sunny location, though they will tolerate part shade.

water: Not specified; generally moderate water needs.
soil: Rich, well-draining soil.
light: Sunny location.

sunflower
overall: Sunflowers are low-maintenance and drought-tolerant flowers that grow in most soil conditions. Provide flowers with plenty of daily sunlight, whether in a garden or containers, for at least six to eight hours

water: Not specified; generally moderate water needs.
soil: Not specified; generally well-draining soil.
light: Not specified; generally partial shade to full shade.

white batflower
overall: When bat flower is outdoors, it should be placed in shade. Indoors, it should be in bright, but not direct, light.

water: Keep soil consistently moist.
soil: Not specified; generally well-draining soil.
light: Bright, indirect light.

zinnia
overall: Zinnias are thirsty plants. Give them a good dousing at the roots once a week during dry periods. Pay particular attention to zinnias in pots and notice when the compost starts to dry out; this may be daily during hot weather. Feed zinnias through summer with a liquid feed, especially if they are in containers. Do this approximately 4-6 weeks after planting, which is about the time the fertilizer in the compost is depleted.
water: Once a week during dry periods.
soil: Moderately fertile, well-draining soil.
light: Full sun.
