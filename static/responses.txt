tulips: Tulips come in a wide variety of colors including red, yellow, pink, purple, orange, and white. Some tulips are even multicolored, featuring streaks, stripes, or edges in contrasting colors. Popular varieties include the Darwin Hybrid, which is known for its large, bright flowers, and the Triumph tulip, prized for its sturdy stems and vibrant hues. Tulips prefer full or afternoon sun, so choose a location that gets at least six hours of direct sunlight per day. The soil must be well-drained and loose; heavy or wet soils can cause the bulbs to rot. Ideally, the soil should be slightly acidic to neutral (pH 6.0 to 7.0). To improve drainage, you can mix in some sand or organic matter such as compost. Tulips require regular watering, especially during their growing season. After planting, water the bulbs thoroughly to settle the soil. During the growing period, ensure the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. Reduce watering once the foliage starts to die back.
roses: Give them what they needâ€“ Generally speaking, roses require at least 6 hours of full sun a day (preferably in the morning), a well-drained and nutrient-rich soil, and moderate amounts of water. Water should only be applied directly to the root zone, not to the leaf surface.
